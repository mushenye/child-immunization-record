/api/immunization-schedules/: CRUD operations for immunization schedules.
Alerts: The application can be configured to send SMS or email alerts automatically (daily) to notify parents of upcoming vaccinations.
Scheduled Tasks
To automatically send SMS alerts daily, use Django-crontab or Celery.

For example, with Django-crontab:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'django_crontab',
